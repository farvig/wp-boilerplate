#Installation guide:

Prerequisites Node and Bower

When those are installed, run the following:

  npm install
  npm install gulp -g

npm install triggers a bower install after all the npm modules have been installed.

After that, start the project by running the gulp command:

  gulp

Gulp will now start a server and open a window with the website.
